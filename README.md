# Who is Sandor?
Sandor Dosa is the original coder for [SCAIKEqC.org](http://scaikeqc.org) and the ScoreKeeper scripts to assist in entering, calculating, and displaying IKEqC scores from around the world.

# What is Sandor doing?
[IKEqC](https://sandordosa.github.io/ikeqc/) is where the magic happens these days, and its Sandor's blog for the project.

# Inter-Kingdom Equestrian Competition Scores
There is a [Historical Mirror](https://sandordosa.github.io/ikeqc_historical/) of just the scores, availble through [IKEqC_Historical](https://github.com/SandorDosa/ikeqc_historical) for interested parties.  This mirror of scores is completely static and is presented as HTML files.  The mirror -- as a stand-alone package -- is released under the Apache License.

# Discord Chat
There is a Discord chat, link available upon request.  Sandor usually keep Discord going in the background while coding, and will -- time permitting -- happily chat with anyone about the project and the current goals.  He tends to leave it running even when he isn't actually at the computer too, so don't feel so bad if he doesn't reply right away.
